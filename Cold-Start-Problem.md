# Cold Start Problem

When the system struggles to make accurate recommendations due to a lack of sufficient data. 
Problem occurs with new users, new items, or when a system is first launched. 

Why? Recc sys rely on past interactions (e.g., ratings, clicks, purchases) to generate suggestions. 

## New User Problem (User Cold - Start):
Occurs when a new user joins the platform with no interaction history.

## New Item Problem (Item Cold-Start):
Occurs when a new item is added to the catalog with no interaction history. 

## New System Problem (System Cold-Start):
Occurs when the recommendation system is newly deployed and has limited interaction data from both users and items.

**Leads to** 
- Poor User Experience
- Low Engagement Rates
- Revenue Loss

**Solutions** 
- New Users : Onboarding Surveys, Demographic-based Recommendations, Content - Based Filtering
- New Items: Metadata-Based Recommendations, Contextual Bandits *, Promotional Boosting 
- New Systems: Random Recommendations with Feedback, Leverage External Data, Collaborative Campaigns. 


**Contextual Bandits** - User exploration - exploitation strategies to show new items randomly and collect feedback. 

**Promotional Boosting** - Feature new items prominently (e.g., “New Arrivals” or “Trending Now” sections)

##
**Hybrid Models**
Collaborative Filtering: Works well with existing interaction data but fails with cold-start.
Content - Based Filtering : Can recommend new items based on their features without prior interactions.
